This is a COVID-19 dashboard to analyze worldwide trends of the virus. 

`backend` contains the helper function files used in the actual dashboard as well as a markdown file used to create test visualizations before implementation on the dashboard.

`data` contains CSV files with some of the relevant data. The helpers file should pull from GitHub sources that are updated regularly, too.
